# Instagram-User-Analytics

User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with our digital product (software or mobile application) in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams.
These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow.
In this project, I have provided a detailed report for the Marketing and Investor metrics department. This analysis will help them to make a decision based on different metrics and insights.

## Approach

For this project, I have used My SQL to extract the required data from the given database using the Join function, subqueries, Aggregation, where condition, Group by,
Distinct and window functions required keeping the Primary key and foreign key in consideration provided all the reports asked by the marketing department and Investor
metrics department.

## Insights and Results

From this project, I got an idea about how as a business or data analyst work on real-time data to take any data-driven decision. One thing I infer about this project is the dataset provided was very limited and small in respect of Rows and columns, but it increases my analytical ability, predictive analysis and also decision-making capability. I have learned advance concepts of SQL while doing this project. It was a very good experience working on such kind of project.
